      <h1>Intro to DnD</h1>
        <p><strong>Dungeons and Dragons (DnD)</strong> is a tabletop roleplaying game where the limit is your creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Find a <strong>gamemaster (or GM)</strong> to conduct a module for you and your friends or become your own GM 
            with thousands of modules available online or in your local bookstore! 
        </p>
        <p>
            You can even create a setting entirely on your own in a method known as <strong>homebrew</strong>. 
            Whether it be locations, races, or spells, anything is possible in your own curated universe!
        </p>
        <p>
            As you will see, there is space for all sorts of creative minds such as artists, mapmakers, musicians, and writers!
            Below is a world map of very my own personal setting called <strong>Aio</strong> .
